<h2><span class="smcap">Taxonomic Notes on Mexican Bats of the<br />
Genus Rhoge&euml;ssa</span></h2>

<h4>BY<br />
E. RAYMOND HALL</h4>


<p>Five skins with skulls of <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa</i>, collected by J. R. Alcorn in the
states of Sonora and Nayarit of western Mexico, were recently received
at the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas. Two other
specimens of the same genus, collected by Walter W. Dalquest in the
state of Veracruz of eastern Mexico, also are in the Museum of Natural
History. With the aim of applying names to these bats they were compared
with materials in the United States National Museum (including the
Biological Surveys collection) where there are approximately the same
number of Mexican specimens of <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa</i> as are in the Museum of
Natural History.</p>

<p>The three kinds of <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa</i> named from Mexico are as follows: <i>R.
parvula</i> from the Tres Marias Islands off the west coast of Nayarit; <i>R.
tumida</i> from Mirador, Veracruz, on the eastern slope of the Republic;
and <i>R. gracilis</i> from Piaxtla, Puebla, on the southern end of the
Mexican Plateau.</p>

<p>Of <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa gracilis</i> Miller (N. Amer. Fauna, 13:126, October 16,
1897) only three specimens are known; two are from Piaxtla, Puebla, and
the third is from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Only the specimen from the
Isthmus has a complete skull. The broken skull of the holotype is partly
separated from the skin of the head and in such a manner as to reveal
the teeth. The skull of the holotype seems to be broader (relative to
its length) across the mastoids and posterior parts of the zygomata than
in <i>R. tumida</i> or than in <i>R. parvula</i>. My comparisons indicate that
<i>Rhoge&euml;ssa gracilis</i> has larger (longer and wider) ears than <i>R.
parvula</i> and <i>R. tumida</i> and that it is specifically distinct from the
two last mentioned kinds.</p>

<p>The two other nominal species from Mexico, <i>R. parvula</i> and <i>R. tumida</i>,
were named and described by Harrison Allen (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.
Philadelphia, 1866: 285 and 286, respectively) on the basis of three
specimens in the United States National Museum. Two were from the Tres
Marias Islands and were the basis of the name <i>R. parvula</i>; the third
was from Mirador, Veracruz, and was the basis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> of the name <i>R. tumida</i>.
These specimens seem to have been preserved in alcohol. I have examined
the skulls of two of these. One (U.S.N.M., new number 37329, old number
7842) is alleged to be the paratype of <i>R. parvula</i> and the other
(U.S.N.M., 84021) is alleged to be the holotype of <i>R. tumida</i>. In the
glass vial containing skull No. 84021, there is a label in the
handwriting of Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., bearing the following information:
"In the orig. descr. the number of this sp. is said to be 8195. This is
an error. Specimen catalogued 3.1.98 G.S.M. Jr." On the back of a second
label in the skull vial there is written, "There is no doubt that this
is the type skull. It was returned by H. A. with no. given in orig.
descr. G.S.M. Jr." In the catalogue of the U. S. National Museum there
is the statement that the type of <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa tumida</i> was collected by H.
A. Grayson.</p>

<p>The name <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa parvula</i> was based on two specimens (Smithsonian
Institution Nos. 7841 the type and 7842, in alcohol, collected by Col.
Grayson in the Tres Marias Islands off the west coast of Mexico.) The
type seems never to have been returned from the Academy of Sciences of
Philadelphia to the U. S. National Museum in Washington, D. C., and
cannot (in 1951) be found in Philadelphia or anywhere else. The skull,
but no other part, of the second specimen is in the United States
National Museum under the catalogue number 37329 (old No. 7842). The
skull has been broken in two through the interorbital region but is
glued together.</p>

<p>Of <i>R. tumida</i>, no additional specimen has been saved, so far as I know,
from the type locality, Mirador, Veracruz.</p>

<p>Of <i>R. parvula</i>, Nelson and Goldman, on May 19, 1897, on Mar&iacute;a Madre
Island, saved in alcohol an additional specimen (92413 U.S.N.M.) from
which J. Biggs, Preparator at the National Museum, in 1951, removed and
cleaned the skull. In small size and in all other features, the skull of
92413 closely resembles those of specimens saved by Alcorn from the
adjoining mainland of Mexico in Sonora and Nayarit. The pelage of the
upper parts of 92413 could be described as "of a light greyish-brown at
basal third, fawn-chestnut-brown at apical two-thirds" which are the
words that H. Allen (<i>op. cit.</i>: 285) used to describe the pelage of his
<i>R. parvula</i>. The external measurements of 92413 are: total length, 60;
length of tail, 25; length of hind foot, 5.5; and ear from notch, 11.0.
The first two measurements are slightly smaller than the corresponding
measurements of any other specimen seen. Nevertheless, the measurements
(tail, 30.5; hind foot, 5.3 [after H. Allen, orig. descr.]) of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
holotype of <i>R. parvula</i>, also from the Tres Marias Islands, show that
it was as large as no. 39724 from the adjoining mainland (see table 1).</p>

<p>According to the original descriptions, <i>R. parvula</i> and <i>R. tumida</i>
differ in size, <i>R. parvula</i> being the smaller. As may be seen from
table 1, the alleged type of <i>R. tumida</i> and the alleged paratype of <i>R.
parvula</i> indicate the opposite! All specimens obtained since the time of
the original descriptions, as may be seen by inspecting table 1, support
the correctness of the original descriptions. Therefore, and also
because of the other information presented above, I am inclined to the
opinion that the holotype of <i>R. tumida</i> and the paratype of <i>R.
parvula</i> have been switched; each now is associated with the name and
data, at least for locality, of the other.</p>

<p>Other opinions are that <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa</i> from the Tres Marias Islands average
smaller than <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa</i> of the adjoining mainland of western Mexico but
not enough smaller to warrant subspecific separation of the two.
Specimens from places geographically intermediate between the geographic
ranges, as now known, of <i>R. parvula</i> and <i>R. tumida</i> probably will
reveal intergradation between the two kinds, which, therefore, should
stand as subspecies of a single species.</p>

<p>As understood now, the Mexican <i>Rhoge&euml;ssa</i> are as follows:</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
